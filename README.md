### Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a doubly linked list data structure. The implementation consists of two main classes: `Node` and `DoublyLinkedList`. The `Node` class represents a node in the doubly linked list, and the `DoublyLinkedList` class provides various operations to manipulate the list.

### Files

- `Node.h`: Header file defining the `Node` class, which represents a node in the doubly linked list.
- `Node.cpp`: Implementation file for the `Node` class.
- `DoublyLinkedList.h`: Header file defining the `DoublyLinkedList` class, which implements the doubly linked list data structure.
- `DoublyLinkedList.cpp`: Implementation file for the `DoublyLinkedList` class.
- `Source.cpp`: Main source file containing a sample program demonstrating the usage of the `DoublyLinkedList` class.

### Usage

To use the doubly linked list implementation in your C++ project:

1. Include the necessary header files (`Node.h` and `DoublyLinkedList.h`) in your source files.
2. Create an instance of the `DoublyLinkedList` class.
3. Use the provided member functions to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal on the doubly linked list.

### Sample Program

The `Source.cpp` file contains a sample program demonstrating the usage of the doubly linked list implementation. It provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations on the doubly linked list, such as inserting nodes, deleting nodes, finding values, and counting nodes.

Feel free to explore and use this doubly linked list implementation in your C++ projects!
